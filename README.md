# Real_Time_Bus_Tracker

<h2>Description of the project:</h2>

This project uses google map and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Bus data to provide a live update on the location of the buses.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>

This map automatically updates the bus locations every second. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>

I plan to
- add more styles to the Google Map
- add bus name, route, vacancy information when user hoover over a bus icon
- maybe overlay a bus route map
