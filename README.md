# Real_Time_Bus_Tracker

<h2>Description of the project:</h2>

This project uses the MBTA bus data to determine the stops between Harvard and MIT. It includes an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus route.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>

Click on the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" on the upper left hand corner of the map. You will see the animiated red marker move from MIT to Harvard in 1 second (1000ms) increments.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>

I plan to
- highlight the route;
- Add MIT and Harvard logo as well as other landmark logos along the route
- Change the marker to look like a puppy or a bus
